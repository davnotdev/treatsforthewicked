# Treats for the Wicked

Hi!
This is my entry for the [Autumn Hackjam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/autumn-hackjam-2023).
This is a game about trick or treat-ing and beating up children for candy.
Its very shitty, but its built using
[mewo](https://github.com/davnotdev/mewo)
and
[mepeyew](https://github.com/davnotdev/mepeyew),
two of my prized possessions.
Had a lot of fun and frustration while making this, so please enjoy this masterpiece while it lasts.
Check it out on [itch.io](https://davnotdev.itch.io/treats-for-the-wicked).
